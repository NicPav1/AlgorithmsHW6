Dynamic programming implementation for the following Algorithms Homwework problem:

You want to learn how to invest to make some money outside class. A new kind of cryptocurrency, Badgercoin (BDC), has caught your attention, but the fluctuations of the BDC to USD exchange rate set you back. One day you accidentally discover a time machine, which allows you to travel back in time n days. You want to make use of it to make money with BDC.
The array A[1,...,n] represents the BDC to USD exchange rate during those n days. For example, A[2] = 50 means that on day 2 you can either buy some x Badgercoins for 50 Â· x dollars, or buy some y dollars for y/50 Badgercoins (i.e., a Badgercoin on the 2nd day is worth 50 dollars). However, you are also charged the following transaction fees: d dollars for each transaction from dollars into Badgercoins, and b Badgercoins for each transaction from Badgercoins into dollars.
Given the exchange rates A, the initial dollars k, the transaction fees b and d, design an algorithm to compute the maximum amount of dollars you can have at the end of the n-th day Your algorithm should run in time O(n) and space O(1).
